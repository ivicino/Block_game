Block_game

Welcome to my project using the Q-learning algorithm to control the player character of my game. My game is a simple game, not too fun for the human gamer, but it is a great environment, in my opinion, to test the AI algorithm. It is a simple game with the objective of getting the red square to overlap with the green square. 

The user controlled version of the game is called block_game.py (creative, right?) 

AI controlled game:
To control this game with an AI I shrunk the game screen to be 200 x 200, to decrease the size of the Q_table used to control the player character, and have two relevant files needed to run the game. The first file is the environment file, block_game_AI.py, and the second file is the AI which controls the player character, agent.py. To run the game, after installing all the relevant modules necessary to run it, which are pretty standard modules including pygame, you need to run the agent.py file. It will call the block_game_AI.py file to create the environment and run the game. 

If you want to see how it would look and the process I took to make this game, check out my instagram (https://www.instagram.com/neurodude64/) where I have videos documenting the creation of this game. If you like my instagram content, consider following me and liking my content/commenting on it. 

Enjoy the game!
